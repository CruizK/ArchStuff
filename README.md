# Behold, My Stuff
This is a repository where I plan on storing all my arch-based / linux-based configs, scripts, etc.

As for why? I usually swap between using linux and not for a while, usually because I'm lazy but love tinkering.

## Install Script & Second Script
To install arch you can run the install script and give it the drive you wish to use, note it wipes this whole drive, you can see what partitions it makes in the disks.part file.

The second script will do any chroot functions such as setting up the hostname, grub, etc. 

Note: All variables that should be changed are declared at the top of scripts, with a comment saying to change them depending on what you want.
